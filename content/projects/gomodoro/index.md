Gomodoro is a simple CLI Pomodoro timer written in Go, built while I was learning the language. It has customizable session times, an optional beep sound, and a progress bar to track the session's progressâ€”all within the terminal.

## Key Features

- Customizable Work & Break Sessions via command-line flags.
- Progress bar visualization for session tracking.
- Optional beep sound when a session ends.
- Auto-start mode to automatically transition between sessions.
