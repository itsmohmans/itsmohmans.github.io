A collection of user scripts designed to enhance the usability of PSUTâ€™s student portal, improving study plan navigation, viewing exams, and some other interface customization that fit my needs solved some problems that I encountered while using my unviersity's portal.

## Key Features

- Study Plan Enhancer
  - Makes viewing the study plan easier by color-coding courses based on their state.
  - Adds a way to track registered courses and their credit hours.
- Better Exams View
  - Highlighting different exams types and past exams.
  - Restore them in their old place.
- Add a sidebar toggle to show/hide it.
