PomoDo is a simple yet effective Material Design Pomodoro timer built with Nuxt 3 to help improve focus and productivity. Originally created to help me while studying for exams, it offers a clean, distraction-free experience with customizable session times and essential features.

PomoDo stores all settings locally in the browser for a privacy-friendly experience without tracking or data collection. It also works as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing users to install it directly from their browser for a better UX.

## Key Features

- Customizable session times.
- Browser notifications with alarm sounds.
- Dark & light themes.
- Progressive Web App (PWA) to install it as an app for quick access.
- Privacy-Friendly: All settings and future data (like stats) are saved locallyâ€”no tracking.
